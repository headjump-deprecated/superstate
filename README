Superstate
==========

I looked a lot through Statemachine implementations and always missed something... So here is my take on it.

My aim is to create something with a syntax like this:

@@@

new Superstate({
  idle: new IdleState(),
  movement: new MovementState({
    walk: new WalkState(),
    jump: new JumpState()
  }),
  attack: new AttackState({
    kick: new KickAttackState(),
    shotgun: new ShotgunAttackState({
      primary: new ShotgunPrimaryState(),
      secondary: new ShotgunSecondaryState()
    })
  })
}).initialState("idle").to("walk");

@@@

... Just need some time to figure everything out.
